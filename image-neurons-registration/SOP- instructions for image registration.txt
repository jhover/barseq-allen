Script #1: 
a00_preprocessbarseq_todaysdate.m

Setup for new computers:
Change all paths to point to your python environments
	line 163 (n2v processing)
	line 335 (n2v geneonly)
	line 365 (bardensr)
Set number of workers to number of cores at beginning, and also within functions
*make sure your parallel pool is configured and set to never shut down
	line 4
	line 431
	line 471
	line 536
Put folder "n2v models" onto disk you are registering on (same level as experiment folder)
in n2vprocessing.py (and other n2v python scripts), change path to n2v model folder if necessary (default is e://n2v_models)	

Necessary files:
raw images for geneseq, hybridization cycle and/or barseq cycles (geneseq0n... bcseq0n... hyb01)
n2vprocessing.py **note! If different number of geneseq cycles from default of 7, change this code accordingly
n2vprocessing_bc.py **same note as above
codebookM1all.mat **may change based on your gene panel
codebookhyb.mat


Notes for running
Run from beginning to end, if you have only geneseq and hyb cycles it will run fine and break when it tries to 
	organize bcseq. 
First time you run this on new computer, may want to run one section at a time
We may be updating the stitching section. For now, this also requires plugins for FIJI, and a link to 
	the correct path


Script #2
a01_processbarseq_todaysdate.m
Setup for new computers:
Change all paths to point to your python environments
	line 201 (n2v processing)
	line 237 (bardensr)
	Line 273 (cellpose)
Set number of workers to number of cores at beginning, and also within functions
*make sure your parallel pool is configured and set to never shut down
	line 308
	line 446
	line 410

BEFORE running code:
1. Add multiplier to line 14 if this is not the only batch of slides in your experiment. 
2. Change starting slide idx on line 65

Necessary files:
All files created by a00
bardensrbasecall.py
bardensrbasecall_predefinedthresh.py
thresh_refined.txt
Cellsegmentation-v065.py
