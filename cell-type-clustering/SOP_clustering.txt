Initiation:
1. Finish a01 process data. Get filt_neurons.mat file
2. Copy all files in clustering pipeline folder to your experiment's (on teams) analysis folder
3. Open Rstudio and save a new project
	File - new project - existing directory -> save in your analysis folder (on teams)
4. Open 00
	Write a new convert_yyyymmdd = function() with todays date, filt_neurons file name and barseqrds(todaysdate)
	example:
	convert_20230331 = function() {
  	sce = convert_v7_filtneurons("filt_neurons_subset.mat")
 	saveRDS(sce, "barseq_20230331.rds")    
	}

	Change last line to new convert function
	example:
	if (sys.nframe() == 0) {
  	convert_20230331()
	}
	save
5. Open dataset.R
	on line 8, change barseqrds to same file in 00 
	example:
	load_barseq = function(filename="barseq_20220331.rds"...
	save


H1 Clustering: (inhibitory/excitatory/subcortical types)
6. open 03
	Lines 8-15:
	Make sure on first clustering run, all lines commented out except "analyze whole"
	example: 
	main = function() {
    	barseq = load_barseq(normalization_factor = 10)
    	logcounts(barseq) = log1p(cpm(barseq))/log(2)
    
    	analyze_whole(barseq)
    	#analyze_glu(barseq)
    	#analyze_gaba(barseq)
    	#subcluster_glu(barseq)
	save
7. open 04
	lines 8-14
	Make sure on first clustering run, all lines commented out except -plot_analysis("analysis/whole", "figs/whole")
	example:
	main = function() {
   	 plot_analysis("analysis/whole", "figs/whole")
  	  #plot_analysis("analysis/glu", "figs/glu")
  	  #plot_analysis("analysis/gaba", "figs/gaba")
 	  #plot_subglu()
  	  #plot_analysis("analysis/IT45","figs/IT45")
	}
	save
8. In terminal type: Initial00to04.bat
	run
	This will take a few hours, depending on your data size

9. Open pdfs, visualizations are stored in figs -> whole. 
	open preliminary_analysis to look at full umap. Make sure it looks smooth/converged. Keep this up
	open all_slices. Check for any obvious batch effects or issues with slices
	In "slice" subfolder, open a representative slice. 
10. Open 05, change names to annotate whole clusters (annotate_whole)
	Make sure you have right number of cluster for this dataset, it will change 
	For each cluster, mark it "Glu_#", "GABA_#", or "SubCTX_#", with a unique number for each cluster. 
		Which number goes to which cell type is unimportant.
	Generally data usually fall in two major clusters, GABA and Glu, which are separated by inhibitory and excitatory
		markers in the preliminary analysis pdf. Use this pdf primarily to distinguish H1 subtypes. GLU clusters
		have high expression of exciatory Slc17a7, and GABA have high expression of inhibitory marker Gad1, but 
		for GABA not all of the clusters in this class may have high levels of Gad1. Use Slc17a7 exp to distinguish
		main H1 types. 
	Only mark a cluster GABA_# or GLU_# if some neurons are in the cortex/hippocampus, otherwise mark SubCTX
11. When you have annotated all clusters, change main function so annotate_whole() is uncommented
	example:
	main = function() {
    	annotate_whole()
   	#annotate_glu()
	#annotate_gaba()
	#annotate_subglu()
	}
	save
12. Run 05
13. Open 03
	comment out analyze_whole()
	uncomment analyze_glu() and analyze_gaba()
14. Open 04
	comment out  plot_analysis("analysis/whole", "figs/whole")
	uncomment  plot_analysis("analysis/glu", "figs/glu")
	uncomment  plot_analysis("analysis/gaba", "figs/gaba")
15. In terminal type: Iterate03to04.bat
	run
	This will take a few hours, depending on your data size


H2 Clustering:  (subclass level spearated by inhibitory and excitatory types)
16. Open pdfs for glutamate+ cells, visualizations are stored in figs -> glu. 
	open preliminary_analysis to look at glutamate umap. Make sure it looks smooth/converged. Keep this up
	open all_slices. Check for any obvious batch effects or issues with slices
	open marker_scores.pdf. This is particularily useful for picking out exciatatory 
	in "cell_types" subfolder, open each type as you go to label cell types
17. open 05, change names to annotate glu clusters (annotate_glu)
	Annotate each cluster. For typical datasets containing cortical neurons, there is one cluster for each of these 
		main cortical exciatory cell types: (name with underscores, slashes break later scripts)
	L2_3_IT
	L4_5_IT
	L5_IT
	L6_IT
	L5_ET
	L6_CT
	L6b
	NP
	Car3
		These clusters can be distinugished by their cortical depth, typical distributions, and by the relative
		weight of marker scores in that area of the glu umap. 
		All other clusters that don't fall into these categories can be labeled descriptively, for example
	Pir
	CA1
	CA3
	BLA
	Low_qual

	save
18. Repeat these steps and annotate GABA subtypes. In our datasets we are not currently optimizing for specific detection of 
	GABA subtypes. Therefore, we usually justn name each cluster "gaba_#"
	example:
	annotate_gaba = function(output_dir = "analysis/gaba") {
   	 cluster_annotation = tribble(
       	 ~cluster_id, ~cluster, ~subclass,
    		  1, "gaba_1","gaba_1",
   	          2, "gaba_2","gaba_2",
        	  3, "gaba_3","gaba_3",
      		  4, "gaba_4","gaba_4",
      		  5, "gaba_5","gaba_5",
	Make sure you label all the clusters. You can be more descriptive if you like, or label some "low_qual", etc
	
	save
19.  When you have annotated all clusters, change main function so annotate_glu() and annotate_gaba are uncommented
	example:
	main = function() {
    	#annotate_whole()
   	annotate_glu()
	annotate_gaba()
	#annotate_subglu()
	}
	save
20. Run 05
21. Open 03
	Comment out analyze_glu() and analyze_gaba()
	Uncomment subcluster_subglu()
	save
22. Open 04
	comment out  plot_analysis("analysis/glu", "figs/glu")
	comment out  plot_analysis("analysis/gaba", "figs/gaba")
	Uncomment plot_subglu
	save
23. In terminal type: Iterate03to04.bat
	run
	This will take a few hours, depending on your data size

H3 labeling (type level, within subclass. Only glutamate cell types)

NOTE - be very careful here to get the NAMES of the cluster_id and the NUMBER of each correct, any deviation will break
	the code that assigns these labels in filt_neurons

24. Name and label each subcluster for glutamate cell types. This goes in this order:
	 ~cluster_id, ~cluster, ~subclass,~notes,
	cluster_id - must match exactly to the name of subclass_#. E.g. if you called your H2 type L5_ET, and there are 8
		clusters, you must write L5_ET_# for all 8. 
	cluster - gives your cluster a descriptive name. You can just write out cluster_id again if you don't want to 
		be more descriptive. 
	subclass - is the H2 type this subcluster belongs to. Typically, this will be the same as the original designation
		(e.g. L5_ET) but occasionally you get mixed clusters where one of the subclusters is actually part of 
		another subclass. Designate this accordingly. 
	notes - any notes on this subclass, longer description, or leave blank

Example, non descriptive

        "L5_IT_1","L5_IT 1","L5_IT"," ",
        "L5_IT_2","L5_IT 2","L5_IT"," ",
        "L5_IT_3","BLA 1","BLA"," ",
        "L5_IT_4","L5_IT 4","L5_IT"," ",

Example, more descriptive

        "L5_IT_1","L5_IT lateral","L5_IT"," lateral L5IT type",
        "L5_IT_2","L5_IT ventral","L5_IT"," ventral L5IT type enriched in SST",
        "L5_IT_3","BLA medial","BLA","medial basolateral amygdala ",
        "L5_IT_4","L5_IT RSP","L5_IT","L5IT type restricted to RSP",

	save
25. Uncomment annotate_subglu() in 05 and comment out other lines in main function. Run 05

Add all cluster names to filt_neurons in MATLAB
26. open a01_0_assignclusterlabels.m 
	Change name of filt_neurons file, line 4
	If you want, change the name of the new filename to be saved, line 15
	Run
	*if you get an error, it is probably because you have the wrong number/names of clusters in the annotation. 
	Check annotation for H3 types in particualr, but also H2 types.
